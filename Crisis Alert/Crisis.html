As of 2020 it was estimated that 38.9 million children under 5 years of age had moderate or severe overweight. There has been no progress to stem the rate of overweight in children under 5 years of age in nearly 20 years. In order to respond to current global epidemiology and to complement existing prevention-focused guidelines, the World Health Organization (WHO) is currently developing a practice and science-informed, people-centred guideline on the integrated management of children 0-9 years of age in all their diversity with obesity using a primary health care approach.</td>
